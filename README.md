## Project Directory Structure Overview

This project is structured to maintain a clean and efficient architecture, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of each directory within the `src` folder and their respective roles.

### Directory Structure

The `src` folder contains several subdirectories, each with a specific purpose:

```
src/
│
├── Controllers/
│ ├── [Controller Files]
│ └── ...
│
├── Database/
│ ├── [Database Configuration and Scripts]
│ └── ...
│
├── Middleware/
│ ├── [Middleware Functions]
│ └── ...
│
├── Models/
│ ├── [Data Models]
│ └── ...
│
├── Repositories/
│ ├── [Data Access Logic]
│ └── ...
│
├── Server/
│ ├── [Server Initialization and Configuration]
│ └── ...
│
├── Services/
│ ├── [Business Logic and Service Layer]
│ └── ...
│
└── Test/
├── [Test Scripts and Suites]
└── ...
```


### Directory Descriptions

#### Controllers
- **Purpose**: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses back to the client. They act as an intermediary between the `Models` and `Views`.
- **Contents**: This directory contains controller files which define functions for various endpoints.

#### Database
- **Purpose**: Manages database configurations, migrations, and seed scripts.
- **Contents**: Includes files for setting up database connections, schema definitions, and any scripts for initializing or populating the database.

#### Middleware
- **Purpose**: Contains middleware functions that process incoming requests before they reach the controllers.
- **Contents**: Custom middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

#### Models
- **Purpose**: Defines data structures and models for the application.
- **Contents**: Includes classes or objects representing entities in the application, often mirroring the structure of database tables.

#### Repositories
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the logic required to access data sources.
- **Contents**: Contains files that interact directly with the database, abstracting the data layer from the service layer.

#### Server
- **Purpose**: Houses the core server configuration, initialization, and startup scripts.
- **Contents**: Includes the main file (`server.js`) that initializes and starts the Express server.

#### Services
- **Purpose**: Implements the business logic of the application.
- **Contents**: Contains service files that handle business logic, called by controllers to perform operations before sending a response.

#### Test
- **Purpose**: Contains all test scripts and suites for the application.
- **Contents**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and any other test scripts to ensure the application functions as expected.

### Conclusion

This structure is designed to promote a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain. Each directory has a distinct role, ensuring that the application remains organized as it scales.


## Project Routing Structure

This project uses a modular approach for managing routes in an Express.js application. Routes are organized into separate directories and files within subfolders, allowing for a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. Below is an overview of the routing structure and instructions on how to navigate and extend it.



### Directory Structure

The project's directory structure for routing is organized as follows (example):

```
MySoftwareStore/
│
├── Routes/
│ ├── HomeRoutes/
│ │ ├── Routes/
│ │ │ ├── MainRoute.js
│ │ │ └── AboutRoute.js
│ │ └── index.js
│ │
│ └── UserRoutes/
│ ├── Routes/
│ │ ├── CreateUser.js
│ │ ├── DeleteUser.js
│ │ ├── GetUser.js
│ │ └── ...
│ └── index.js
│
└── app.js
```


### Routing Modules

#### UserRoutes

- **Overview**: The `UserRoutes` directory contains a `Routes` subfolder with individual route files for user-related operations such as creating, deleting, and retrieving users.
- **Files**:
  - `Routes/CreateUser.js`: Handles user creation requests.
  - `Routes/DeleteUser.js`: Manages user deletion requests.
  - `Routes/GetUser.js`: Responsible for fetching user data.
  - `index.js`: This file consolidates all the user routes from the `Routes` subfolder and exports them as a single module.

#### HomeRoutes

- **Overview**: The `HomeRoutes` directory follows a similar structure to `UserRoutes`, with a `Routes` subfolder containing routes for home page-related functionalities.
- **Files**:
  - `Routes/[Home Route Files]`: Each file corresponds to a specific home page-related route.
  - `index.js`: Consolidates all home routes from the `Routes` subfolder into one module.

### How to Use

- **In Individual Route Files** (e.g., `UserRoutes/Routes/CreateUser.js`): Define routes specific to a single functionality or endpoint.
- **In `index.js` of Each Route Directory**: Import all route files from the `Routes` subfolder and use `router.use()` to consolidate them into a single router object.
- **In Main Application File (`/Utility/Routes.js`)**: Import the consolidated route modules from each `index.js` file and use them with `app.use()` to integrate into the main application.

### Extending Routes

To add a new route:
1. Create a new route file in the respective `Routes` subfolder (e.g., `UserRoutes/Routes/NewRoute.js`).
2. Define the route logic in this file.
3. Import and use this new route file in the `index.js` of the respective directory.

### Conclusion

This modular routing approach helps in keeping the application routes organized and scalable, making it easier to manage and extend the functionality of the application.
