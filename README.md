## Project Directory Structure Overview

This project is structured to maintain a clean and efficient architecture, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of each directory within the `src` folder and their respective roles.

### Directory Structure

The `src` folder contains several subdirectories, each with a specific purpose:

```

```


### Directory Descriptions

#### Controllers
- **Purpose**: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses back to the client. They act as an intermediary between the `Models` and `Views`.
- **Contents**: This directory contains controller files which define functions for various endpoints.

#### Database
- **Purpose**: Manages database configurations, migrations, and seed scripts.
- **Contents**: Includes files for setting up database connections, schema definitions, and any scripts for initializing or populating the database.

#### Middleware
- **Purpose**: Contains middleware functions that process incoming requests before they reach the controllers.
- **Contents**: Custom middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

#### Models
- **Purpose**: Defines data structures and models for the application.
- **Contents**: Includes classes or objects representing entities in the application, often mirroring the structure of database tables.

#### Repositories
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the logic required to access data sources.
- **Contents**: Contains files that interact directly with the database, abstracting the data layer from the service layer.

#### Server
- **Purpose**: Houses the core server configuration, initialization, and startup scripts.
- **Contents**: Includes the main file (`server.js`) that initializes and starts the Express server.

#### Services
- **Purpose**: Implements the business logic of the application.
- **Contents**: Contains service files that handle business logic, called by controllers to perform operations before sending a response.

#### Test
- **Purpose**: Contains all test scripts and suites for the application.
- **Contents**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and any other test scripts to ensure the application functions as expected.

### Conclusion

This structure is designed to promote a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain. Each directory has a distinct role, ensuring that the application remains organized as it scales.


## Project Routing Structure

This project uses a modular approach for managing routes in an Express.js application. Routes are organized into separate directories and files within subfolders, allowing for a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. Below is an overview of the routing structure and instructions on how to navigate and extend it.
